Journal information pages are contained in the *about* and *contact* directories.The *current* directory will build a contents page for the journal's current issue, which can be set in config.toml. Journal issues should be in separate directories within *article*. For each article, create a .md file for the article containing the metadata for the article and links to the relevant galley files. JATS XML files will be rendered using a modified version of eLife Lens Viewer.",
